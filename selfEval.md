# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  I didn't! It was really good practice for me. Felt like a giant breeze compared to yesterday's work.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  I think I can improve. I'm trying to implement screenshots into my note taking during classes and from the lessons/practice. I find it helpful to read aloud and then jot down what I understand in my own words.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  I Google when I feel lost (which is often), and then ask for help from others as well. Today I figured out some error messages in Terminal on my own, which made me feel really good and hopefully I can do that some more!
